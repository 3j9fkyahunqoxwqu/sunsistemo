Sunsistemo is a numerical N-body simulator written in JavaScript.
[It runs completely in the browser](https://sunsistemo.js.org/). Given a set of
initial conditions it will evolve the chosen system and visualize it in 3D, all
in real-time.

This was a project done for the course "Introduction to Computational Science"
as part of the
[Computational Science Master program](http://gss.uva.nl/future-msc-students/information-sciences/content27/computational-science.html).
